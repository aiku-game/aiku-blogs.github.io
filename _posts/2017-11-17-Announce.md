title: NOVEMBER GAME ANNOUNCEMENT!

---

Welcome!
  Over the past 2 months, starting from September, we have started our development into creating a game! Columbia College Chicago Senior Students are proud to to dive into, and create an ambitious game for the WHOLE SCHOOL YEAR. 

For one whole year, students are going head first to make a game that reflects their creativity, design, and programming prowess. I encourage everyone to take a look, ask questions, and see frequent updates on the game they are proud to present.
