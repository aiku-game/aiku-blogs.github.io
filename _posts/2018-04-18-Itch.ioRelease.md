As the ship's "caretaker bot," you are responsible for allocation of the now-precious energy reserves. Solve puzzles by powering different objects around the ship, and enter simulations created from the crewmembers' memories. Your task is to allocate all power to the crew life support systems, in the hope that they will be kept alive until rescue. But what if all the power on the ship simply isn't enough?
Aiku is the culmination of Columbia College Chicago's 2018 large team game capstone course - a nine-month collaborative project involving over forty students. Visit aiku-game.com to learn more, or send us an email at ccclargeteam@gmail.com!
We hope to share our passion for games through the development of Aiku, and hopefully expand further, as we dive deeper into the Game Industry as professionals. With that, we hope to see everyone at GDC Expo 2018!
