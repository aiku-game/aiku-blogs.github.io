title: DEVELOPMENT UPDATE FOR GDC 2018!

---

We, Columbia College Chicago Senior Capstone Students, are proud to announce Aiku, as our capstone game. We wish to participate and showcase at GDC 2018! We will be representing Columbia College Chicago and our game.

We hope to share our passion for games through the development of Aiku, and hopefully expand further, as we dive deeper into the Game Industry as professionals. With that, we hope to see everyone at GDC Expo 2018!
